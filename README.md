## Upcoming Meetups

### [PyData Prague #21 - Duck Hyping](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/301435048/) (17.6.2024 at Keboola)

#### František Kaláb - How Data Improves Your Life in Prague

At Prague Data Platform, we collect, process, and evaluate data from the city to enhance decision-making and improve the lives of its citizens. From waste management to public transport, this talk will provide an overview of the city's data landscape and showcase specific areas where data is leveraged to the city's advantage. I will also discuss how we utilize open-source technologies and adhere to open standards to make our work transparent and accessible to clients and citizens.

#### David Ešner - DuckDB Intro with Case Study from Keboola

DuckDB is a powerful tool for data analysts and data engineers. It is an embedded, in-process database that provides connectors and capabilities comparable to complex query engines like Spark or Presto, yet it's as simple to set up as SQLite. In this talk, I will provide a brief introduction to the technology and how we leverage it as a simple magic wand for easy, in-process data crunching within the Keboola container architecture. I will walk you through our rather unusual use cases

## Past Meetups

### [Open Source Science @ PyData Prague #20](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/300721007/) (16.5.2024 at FNSPE CTU)

A joint event of PyData Prague and [Open-Source Science (OSSci)](https://opensource.science/).

##### Tim Bonnemann - Accelerating Science with Open Source – An Introduction to Open-Source Science (OSSci) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vExaIha3EghKTuNzYitThRSHyJyo1n_8Wv61wc97A4w/edit?usp=sharing))

Open-Source Science (OSSci) is a NumFOCUS initiative – launched in July 2022 in partnership with IBM – that aims to accelerate scientific research by improving the ways open source software in science gets done (built, used, funded, sustained, recognized, etc.). OSSci connects scientists, OSS developers and other stakeholders to share best practices, identify common pain points, and explore solutions together. The five OSSci interest groups to date cover domain-specific topics (chemistry/materials, life sciences/healthcare, climate/sustainability) as well as cross-domain topics (reproducibility, map of science), with more to be rolled out in 2024. This talk will provide a brief overview of OSSci’s activities to date, our plans for 2024, and how you can get involved.

##### Evelina Gabašová - Open source and academia: Research software engineering perspective ([slides](https://evelinag-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/evelina_evelinag_onmicrosoft_com/EUHCeHOfv1VLpHbLlpQ0NLsBdLmA8XQpCMqnWtdhPkZlUw?e=haflN2))

In the British academic system, a new movement was established in 2012 called "research software engineering". The goal has been to recognise and promote the vital role of software in research and establish academic career paths for people who develop it. As a Vice-President of the Society of Research Software Engineering (and a research software engineer herself), Evelina will talk about some of the lessons learned over the past decade and what have been the challenges in recognising software and open source contributions as fully-fledged academic outputs.

##### Derek Homeier - Astropy – a community effort to develop a common core package for Astronomy in Python ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihnrbs0n5G72gT4reLZ0mG80_DitmrQg/view?usp=sharing))

Since the early 2010s Python has been recognised as a powerful option offering an
alternative to then-dominant proprietary platforms like IDL or Matlab, or compiled
(and often also proprietary) languages like Fortran and C++, for scientific data processing
in the astrophysics research community. The need to implement efficient array computation
and visualisation led to significant contributions to evolving modules like Numarray/Numpy
and Matplotlib from some institutions and many individuals in the community; yet individual
needs also started to set off a proliferation of independent solutions.
Astropy was created to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages,
sharing common coding standards and data APIs, to allow and actively encourage
contributors throughout the astronomical community to invest their development
work into a widely usable and professionally maintained package.
A decade later this has made Python+Astropy now the dominant data-processing platform
in astrophysical research. But with this growth the project has also evolved from a relatively
informal team effort to a more formally organised and structured system.

##### Martin Fleischmann - Open by Default: Developing reproducible, computational research ([slides](https://martinfleischmann.net/talks/2024_OSSci_meetup/))

While academic research heavily depends on open-source software, the relationship is often one-way. We believe that designing research in close relation to open-source development is beneficial for all parties and present one way of doing that, by turning a research project into a component of the open-source ecosystem.

Academic research often depends on open-source software. Still, researchers do not contribute back that often due to the lack of institutional incentives, time demands, or an imposter syndrome (“my code is too messy”). However, open-source software development doesn’t have to be detached from academic work. The first step is a decision to make the code open. Then the question is, how? From an academic standpoint, packing up the functionality into a new package instead of contributing to existing libraries could lead to additional publications that matter in career progress. However, from an open-source standpoint, such an approach widens the ecosystem’s fragmentation and threatens its sustainability. In this talk, we outline why we chose the path benefiting open source over the academic benefits, how we did it and our vision of academic work closely linked to open-source development. We illustrate this approach in our work on the Urban Grammar AI project, combining aspects of radical openness of the process, making research code available as it is written, and enhancing existing libraries when we need new functionality. It led to significant contributions to the GeoPandas and PySAL ecosystems, a release of one independent package with functionality that didn’t fit elsewhere, and further developments of a canonical Docker container for geographic data science.

### [PyData Prague #19 - Pandas in Heaven](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/300451488/) (23.4.2024 at ČSOB)

- A Real-World Example: A step-by-step walkthrough of how we employed RAG to address issues like outdated information, domain knowledge gaps, hallucinations, and other common challenges of LLMs.
- Challenges and Resolutions: reveal the bottlenecks we encountered – be it data quality, retrieval efficiency, model intricacies, or evaluation standards – and the strategies weadopted to navigate them.
- Optimization Tips: Practical advice and best practices to optimize your RAG deployment. By the end of this talk, you will have a clear understanding of if the RAG is the best optionfor you, if yes, how to do it in practice and what challenges to expect and how to address them.

This talk is suitable for data analysts, data scientists and LLMs enthusiast who want to have some understanding on the reality of using LLMs in production. Warning! It is not all roses; it gets dirty so fast.

### [PyData Prague #14 - Voice upon a Time](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/293042146/) (3.5.2023 at Heureka)

#### Karel Boháček -  Sign language recognition: Enabling communication for the hearing-impaired through machine learning

In this talk, our project on sign language recognition will be presented. The aim of the project is to create a prototype app that can facilitate communication between hearing-impaired individuals and those who do not know sign language. The challenges faced by hearing-impaired individuals in communicating with the general population will be discussed, and how technology can help bridge this gap will be explained.

A Python code relying on Mediapipe library will be introduced, and its use in extracting key features from sign language gestures, such as hand and finger positions and movements, will be explained. The machine learning techniques used to recognize and classify these gestures will be delved into. The data preprocessing steps, model selection, and training process will be covered, as well as the evaluation metrics used to measure the accuracy of the model. Finally, the prototype will be showcased, and its operation in real-time will be demonstrated. The limitations of our current approach and potential future developments in the field will also be discussed.

#### Franz Kiraly - A unified interface for machine learning with time series - an introduction

Sktime is a widely used scikit-learn compatible library for learning with time series. sktime is easily extensible by anyone, and interoperable with the pydata/numfocus stack.

This short talk gives an introduction to sktime, the time series learning tasks it addresses, and a summary of usage and interfaces. It further introduces common feature extraction, pipelines and composition building blocks, and explains reduction patterns in sktime – using an estimator or object for one learning task to solve another, e.g., a tabular regressor for forecasting.

This is a basic introduction and an overview talk, no prior knowledge is required.

### [PyData Prague #13 - In Good We Rust](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/290041316/) (13.12.2022 at Deepnote)

#### Ondřej Vostál - Async Python modules in Rust

I'll demonstrate how to write a Python module in Rust. What's more, the module will communicate both ways between Python and Rust using asyncio and tokio. After the talk, you'll be able to write an app that asynchronously processes data in Rust without holding the GIL. The main advantage of this approach as opposed to microservices is less boilerplate and saving the IPC overhead.

#### Jan Soubousta - How we built a Python SDK for our (open) APIs

During this session, we will present how we built and open-sourced a Python SDK for our analytics APIs covered by OpenAPI specification. We will share best practices applied on Python projects (data classes, services, tests, documentation, Github actions, pip, ...). In the end, we will conduct a live demo - Github APIs -> PostgreSQL -> dbt -> GoodData -> Deepnote(GoodData Python SDK).

### [PyData Prague #12 - Minutes to a Degree](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/288395992/) (18. 10. 2022 at LMC)

#### Ondřej Bojar - Machine Translation Usable in Practice, Let's Move to Minuting

During the last eight years of deep neural networks rewriting the landscape of machine translation (MT), we got to the stage where MT is clearly usable and progress hard to measure for language pairs covered well with data. Let us now apply similar technologies to the task of automatic creation of minutes from project meetings ("minuting"). With a similar devotion, we should make automatic minutes usable in a couple of years. And perhaps machine understanding will be necessary at last; to my surprise, it was not needed for MT.

#### Martin Fleischmann - A Gentle Introduction to Spatial Data in the Pandas Ecosystem

"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”
That is the first law of geography. But how do we apply it to data science? How do we ensure that our analysis has a spatial dimension and that it can be mapped? How can we combine data based on their location? Are there any spatial patterns? These are the questions you will be able to answer after a gentle introduction to spatial data science in the pandas ecosystem. We will start with a brief explanation of the key concepts like geometries and projections to introduce GeoPandas, a package that brings geo to pandas. Then we’ll check how the ecosystem supporting GeoPandas looks like and what it offers, followed by a short excursion to the realm of spatial analytics using the packages from the PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library) project. We will be able to expand traditional exploratory data analysis with spatial using the esda package, interpolate data between different spatial units using the tobler package or analyse the structure of cities using momepy. Finally, when the data begin to look too large to work with, we switch to distributed dask-geopandas and wrap up our journey with spatial operations powered by Dask somewhere in the cloud.

### [PyData Prague #11 - Hovering over Capulets](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-prague/events/286566742/) (27. 6. 2022 at Ataccama)

#### Radek Ježek - Using drone imagery to detect vegetation around power lines ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKjYUnT7DRk))

When was the last time you encountered a power outage? You would be a bit concerned if you knew how much of today's critical infrastructure relies on the uninterrupted supply of electricity. How can drones help? This talk explains how we used drone images to automatically detect one of the most common causes of power outages - when trees come dangerously close to the wires.

The presentation will cover the complete workflow:

- Capturing images using automated drone missions.
- Building a 3D model of the terrain.
- Using computer vision and neural networks for detecting wires in the images.
- Building a 3D representation of the wires with epipolar geometry.
- Visualizing the vegetation encroachment.

#### Matěj Račinský - Julia in Python's den ([video](https://youtu.be/U5zt6OZVxrs))

Julia is a rather new programming language, designed for modern scientific computing. This talk will compare Julia to Python, discuss its current state and production-readiness, emphasise its strengths and weaknesses, describe the interoperability with Python, and speculate whether it is now a good time to rewrite all your Python projects in Julia - all that with some important takeaways from more than a year of running Julia in production at Avast.

### [PyData Prague #10 - Pandemic Lite](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/285562340/) (10. 5. 2022 at Creative Dock)

### [PyData Prague #8 - Collaborative Dimensions](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/273506477/) (5. 10. 2020, virtual)

#### Jan Matas - Making data science notebook collaborative ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQr1uMK74F4))

Jupyter notebook is now one of the most popular tools for data scientists, even though it is fairly difficult to work with it in a team setting. In this talk, we will first explore how notebooks work under the hood, then we will discuss how we can build collaboration features to enable real-time editing (like google docs) and finally we will address some security challenges inherent to having collaborative data science tools in the cloud.

#### Ondřej Grover - Xarray, more than Pandas in multiple dimensions ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww4EYv20Ucw), [slides](https://github.com/smartass101/xarray-pydata-prague-2020))

The Xarray library has in recent years become one of the de-facto standards for working with multi-dimensional datasets in Python. While calling it "a generalization of Pandas into multiple dimensions" gives a reasonable first impression, there is much more to it than that. For instance, the transparent and well structured API offers a concise handle on the depths of NumPy and Dask broadcasting magic. The API and helper functions also enable the construction of convenient and versatile wrappers of e.g. Scipy routines which then become applicable in any domain where data can be represented by Xarray containers. The talk will showcase the basic Pandas-like usage as well as some of the aforementioned advanced features.

### [PyData Prague #7 - Call for Community](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/272546041/) (25. 8. 2020 at Klub Avu)

No talks.

### [PyData Prague #6 - Extended Automation](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/267957841/) (3. 2. 2020 at CreativeDock)

#### Adam Hanka - Automation in InsurTech and Banking ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWQM-BCd_T8))

Automation and artificial intelligence can bring improvements in customer experience, shorten application time and simplify the underwriting process, reduce costs and replace some tedious and repetitive human labor such as damage inspection or claim processing. How does it work in the world of finance, especially insurance and banking, both examples of the most traditional industries, posing strong resistance towards changes?

Possible future development in the industry will be demonstrated on two recent data science and machine learning projects:
* Recognition and evaluation of car damages.
* Scoring process based on structured information from social media.

#### Jan Pipek - A practical guide to designing implants for pandas ([slides](https://janpipek.github.io/talks/pydata-prague_2020/#/))

The pandas library offers three approaches to user customization – class inheritance, series/data frame accessors, and extension arrays/dtypes. The talk introduces all of them shortly with real-world examples and code, while focusing on a complete implementation of physical-unit-aware data column example.

### [PyData Prague #5 - Dashing Automobile](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/266462703/) (27. 11. 2019 at Microsoft)

#### Andrej Svitek - Data Science in Automotive industry ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGAZpvad0PU))

The Automotive industry is one of the most important drivers (pun intended) of the Czech economy. With more than 1,4 million cars produced per year, 800 companies involved and 160 000 direct employees, Automotive is considered the largest industry in the Czech Republic accounting for more than 9 % of GDP.

With constant flood of buzzwords (IIoT, Industry 4.0, Digital factory 2.0, Autonomous Driving just to name a few), the aim of this talk is to present a more realistic and data-driven perspective of the industry as well as look at the advantages and challenges of Data Science projects within this environment.

#### Dom Weldon - Dash: Interactive Data Visualization Web Apps with no Javascript ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dewrzMPPLDU), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHTRy6_5D59jmJ_dQQJcFdSxp8_sF8owOTz8n4ltYno/edit#slide=id.g6bad58c9c8_0_95))

Your data science project may need to produce interactive tools and visualizations to allow end-users to explore data and results. Dash, a project by the team that makes Plotly, solves some of these problems by allowing data scientists to build rich and interactive websites in pure Python, with minimal knowledge of HTML and absolutely no Javascript.

This talk will give an overview of Dash, how it works and what it can be used for, before outlining some of the common problems that emerge when data scientists are let loose to produce web applications, and web developers have to work with the pydata ecosystem.

### [PyData Prague #4 - Mapping Science](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/264776737/) (30. 9. 2019 at (A)void Floating Gallery)

#### Diar Masri - Data Science at LMC ([video](https://youtu.be/ztfHcGDf5rs), [slides](talks/diar_masri-2019_30_09.pdf))

Searching for job is a struggle that LMC is trying to simplify. Therefore, I would like to introduce a practical overview of how data science is applied at LMC to achieve such a goal. We do so by applying data science to better understand our users experience and abilities using techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Moreover, we examine current preferences of our users using Recommender System in order to recommend them the most relevant job options and shorten the path to their next career.

Jakub Urban, a senior Pythonista from Quantlane with rich experience in scientific computing and modelling, will show various possibilities for making your (mostly) numerical calculations in Python fast. He will cover optimization and parallelization using Numpy, Numba, Cython or Dask. You will learn that Python can be as fast as Fortran with a very little effort. In case it cannot, you will see how to seamlessly turn Fortran/C/C++ into a Python module.
