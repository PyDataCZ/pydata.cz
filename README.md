# PyData Prague

PyData Prague is a community of data scientists, engineers, analysts, and various other developers in the area of scientific computing and data analysis. The term [PyData](https://pydata.org/) refers to an educational program of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), an american non-profit helping open source software in terms of governance, financial support, and operations.

The PyData network hosts meetups in hundreds of cities around the world and several conferences each year. The Prague chapter started in 2018 with the aim of spreading the word of open source scientific computing in the Czech Republic. And while the chapter is based in Prague, we operate and collaborate countrywide.

## Code of Conduct

We adhere to PyData's code of conduct, here's its short version:

> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes and language are not appropriate for PyData.

## Meetups

We have hosted several meetups, you can check them out on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague). We try and host speakers from various backgrounds, so that our attendees get to find out about all sorts of things possible with the NumFOCUS toolkit (and beyond!).

### [PyData Prague #5 - Dashing Automobile](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/266462703/)

#### Talk 1: Andrej Svitek - Data Science in Automotive industry

The Automotive industry is one of the most important drivers (pun intended) of the Czech economy. With more than 1,4 million cars produced per year, 800 companies involved and 160 000 direct employees, Automotive is considered the largest industry in the Czech Republic accounting for more than 9 % of GDP.

With constant flood of buzzwords (IIoT, Industry 4.0, Digital factory 2.0, Autonomous Driving just to name a few), the aim of this talk is to present a more realistic and data-driven perspective of the industry as well as look at the advantages and challenges of Data Science projects within this environment.

#### Talk 2: Dom Weldon - Dash: Interactive Data Visualization Web Apps with no Javascript

Your data science project may need to produce interactive tools and visualizations to allow end-users to explore data and results. Dash, a project by the team that makes Plotly, solves some of these problems by allowing data scientists to build rich and interactive websites in pure Python, with minimal knowledge of HTML and absolutely no Javascript.

This talk will give an overview of Dash, how it works and what it can be used for, before outlining some of the common problems that emerge when data scientists are let loose to produce web applications, and web developers have to work with the pydata ecosystem.

### [PyData Prague #4 - Mapping Science](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/264776737/)

#### Talk 1: Diar Masri: Data Science at LMC

Searching for job is a struggle that LMC is trying to simplify. Therefore, I would like to introduce a practical overview of how data science is applied at LMC to achieve such a goal. We do so by applying data science to better understand our users experience and abilities using techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Moreover, we examine current preferences of our users using Recommender System in order to recommend them the most relevant job options and shorten the path to their next career.

#### Talk 2: Vojtěch Filipec: Curious about a new place? Explore many of them via OpenStreetMaps API

Knowledge of the neighborhoods may identify deficient services to a marketing company, it also enables you to address your spouse's inquiry about points of interest on a day-trip. To acquire such knowledge, you need a rich source of data with decent API. OpenStreetMaps offer both. This talk explains how to access the data points in OSM and how to query their labels and content using two Python libraries (overpass and overpy) as well as the underlying OSM query language.


### [PyData Prague #3 - Mouse Experience](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/262289857/)

#### Talk 1: Karla Fejfarová: My Data Look Like a Mouse ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl0z5jHmFuc))

This talk will give you a short tour of the Czech Centre for Phenogenomics in the BIOCEV centre in Vestec and a brief overview of current research in mouse-based functional genomics. Karla will also present various types of data we generate during the research and will show you how Python helps us to overcome some of the everyday challenges we face. Karla Fejfar­ová is a biostatistician at the Czech Centre of Phenogenomics.

#### Talk 2: Tomáš Muchka: What the Heck Does UX Mean? ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mocwsew8k))

They work in all kinds of companies from startups to corporates. They could be sitting right next to you; the UX designers. But what is their actual job and how could you help each other? Let's find out with Tomáš Muchka, a senior UX designer at GoodData.


### [PyData Prague #2 - Optimized Elasticity](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/257775220/)

#### Talk 1: The how and why of Elasticsearch ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YJxJbeznQ))

Elasticsearch is an open source distributed datastore, we will see what makes it tick, how to use it from Python and try to draw some conclusions as to where it might fit in in your organization. Honza Král is a principal consulting architect from Elastic and a long-term core committer to Django.

#### Talk 2: Optimizing numerical calculations in Python ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_BRzn4zMnQ))

Jakub Urban, a senior Pythonista from Quantlane with rich experience in scientific computing and modelling, will show various possibilities for making your (mostly) numerical calculations in Python fast. He will cover optimization and parallelization using Numpy, Numba, Cython or Dask. You will learn that Python can be as fast as Fortran with a very little effort. In case it cannot, you will see how to seamlessly turn Fortran/C/C++ into a Python module.

### [PyData Prague - 1st Meetup - Open Source and Open Communities](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague/events/254559250/)

#### Talk 1: NumFOCUS and PyData + Delivering Data Science Projects ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wckJlowTAg))

Ian Ozsvald, a London-based data scientist with 15+ years of experience, he co-founded PyData London, one of the largest PyData communities in the world. Ian will introduce PyData, NumFOCUS and the community behind these initiatives. He'll then talk about successfully delivering a data science project.

#### Talk 2: Symbolic Computing with SymPy ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsOzJ-Co938))

Štěpán Roučka, a contributor to the SymPy project, a computer algebra system widely used within academia and industry, both as a standalone tool and as part of other scientific packages. Štepán will give a brief overview of SymPy's functionality and will show you a few examples, which may motivate you to add SymPy to your data science toolbox.
