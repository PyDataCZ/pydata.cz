## Open-Source Science

[**Open-Source Science (OSSci)**](https://opensource.science) is a NumFOCUS initiative – launched in July 2022 in partnership with IBM – aimed at accelerating scientific research by improving the ways open-source scientific software gets done (built, used, funded, sustained, recognized, etc.). OSSci connects scientists, OSS developers, and other stakeholders to share best practices, identify common pain points, and explore solutions together.

The five OSSci interest groups to date cover domain-specific topics (chemistry and material science, life sciences and healthcare, climate and sustainability) as well as cross-domain topics (reproducibility, [map of science](https://map.opensource.science)), with more to be added in the future.
